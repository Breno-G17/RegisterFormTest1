Hello to who is reading this repository!

The purpose i have built this project is to practice my few skills on coding, since i'm a begginer i have to at least practice what i learn,i know it isn't the best, but it's what i can do for now, i am all ears to criticism and adicvices over my project in order to enhance my code, skills, and gain more knowledge as well, thus feel free to check it out, find minnor and great errors i committed, drop a comment with your honest opnion over this simple form i built in 3 days of coding using HTML ans SASS(i hate CSS, so that i use SASS because it is more pratical and less stressful), i'm probably going to be release updates for it with JavaScript in the future.
